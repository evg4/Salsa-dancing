## Project Title
Salsa dancing
## Description
This was my first project, completed as part of the SheCodes Basics course on 24.04.23. It's a static website with the aim of providing information about salsa dancing. I used HTML and CSS for the appearance, and basic JavaScript to add interactivity with the button.
